privacy policy found below.</p><br>

			<span class="text-xl pb-10">
				<p>Data collection on our website</p><br>
			</span>


			<span class="text-xl">
				Who is responsible for the data collection on this website?<br>
			</span>
			<p>
The data collected on this website are processed by the website operator. The operator's

system you are using or when you accessed the page. These data are collected automatically
as soon as you enter our website.</p><br>


			<span class="text-xl">
				What do we use your data for?<br>
			</span>
			<p>
Part of the data is collected to ensure the proper functioning of the website. Other data
can be used to analyze how visitors use the site.</p><br>

			<span class="text-xl">
				What rights do you have regarding your data?<br>
			</span>
			<p>
You always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its

			</span>


			<span class="text-xl">
				Data protection<br>
			</span>
			<p>

regulations and this privacy policy.</p><br>
<p>
If you use this website, various pieces of personal data will be collected. Personal
information is any data with which you could be personally identified. This privacy policy
explains what information we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for
what purpose this happens.</p><br>

Please note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email communication) may be
subject to security breaches. Complete protection of your data from third-party access is
not possible.</p><br>

			<span class="text-xl">
				Notice concerning the party responsible for this website<br>
			</span>
			<p>The party responsible for processing data on this website is:</p><br>

			<span class="text-xl">
				Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data<br>
			</span>
			<p>
Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke
your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is
sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p><br>

			<span class="text-xl">
				SSL or TLS encryption<br>
			</span>
			<p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the
transmission of confidential content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the site
operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it
changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's
address bar.<p><br>

<p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third
parties.</p><br>

			<span class="text-xl">
				Information, blocking, deletion<br>
			</span>
			<p>
As permitted by law, you have the right to be provided at any time with information free of

legal notice requirements with regard to sending promotional and informational materials not
expressly requested. The website operator reserves the right to take specific legal action if
unsolicited advertising material, such as email spam, is received.</p><br>


			<span class="text-3xl">
				3. Data collection on our website<br>
			</span>

			<span class="text-xl">
				Cookies<br>
			</span>
			<p>
Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any
viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are
small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p><br>

<p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted
after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These
cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.</p><br>

<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide
on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser
can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always
reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies
may limit the functionality of this website.</p><br>

<p>Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain
functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6
paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the
storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If
other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they
will be treated separately in this privacy policy.</p><br>


			<span class="text-xl">
				Server log files<br>
			</span>
			<p>
The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser
automatically transmits to us in "server log files". These are:</p><br>

<ul>
	<li>
	• 	Browser type and browser version
	</li>
	<li>
	• 	Operating system used
	</li>
	<li>
	• 	Referrer URL
	</li>
	<li>
	• 	Host name of the accessing computer
	</li>
	<li>
	• 	Time of the server request
	</li>
	<li>
	• 	IP address
	</li>
</ul><br>

<p>These data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p><br>

<p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data
to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.</p><br>


			<span class="text-3xl">
				4. Analytics and advertising<br>
			</span>


			<span class="text-xl">
				Google Analytics<br>
			</span>
			<p>
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by Google Inc.,
1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p><br>

<p>Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your
computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information
generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google
server in the USA and stored there.</p><br>

<p>Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has
a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its
advertising.</p><br>

			<span class="text-xl">
				IP anonymization<br>
			</span>
			<p>
We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be
shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the
European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases
is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will
use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the
website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services regarding
website activity and Internet usage for the website operator. The IP address transmitted by
your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by
Google.</p><br>

			<span class="text-xl">
				Browser plugin<br>
			</span>
			<p>
You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your
browser. However, we wish to point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy
the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the data generated by cookies
about your use of the website (incl. your IP address) from being passed to Google, and the
processing of these data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin
available at the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.</p><br>

			<span class="text-xl">
				Objecting to the collection of data<br>
			</span>
			<p>
You can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following
link. An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent your data from being collected on future
visits to this site: Disable Google Analytics.</p><br>

<p>For more information about how Google Analytics handles user data, see Google's privacy
policy: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en.</p><br>

			<span class="text-xl">
				Outsourced data processing<br>
			</span>
			<p>
We have entered into an agreement with Google for the outsourcing of our data processing and
fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using
Google Analytics.</p><br>

			<span class="text-xl">
				Demographic data collection by Google Analytics<br>
			</span>
			<p>
This website uses Google Analytics' demographic features. This allows reports to be
generated containing statements about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors. This
data comes from interest-based advertising from Google and third-party visitor data. This
collected data cannot be attributed to any specific individual person. You can disable this
feature at any time by adjusting the ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid
the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described in the section "Refusal of data
collection".</p><br>

			<span class="text-xl">
				Google Analytics Remarketing<br>
			</span>
			<p>
Our websites use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing combined with the cross-device
capabilities of Google AdWords and DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google Inc.,
1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p><br>

<p>This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing created
with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and
Google DoubleClick. This allows advertising to be displayed based on your personal
interests, identified based on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g.
your mobile phone), on other devices (such as a tablet or computer).</p><br>

<p>Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history
with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, any device that signs in to your Google
Account can use the same personalized promotional messaging.</p><br>

<p>To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that
are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross
device ad promotion.</p><br>

<p>You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off
personalized advertising in your Google Account; follow this link: https://www.google.com/
settings/ads/onweb/?hl=en.</p><br>

<p>The aggregation of the data collected in your Google Account data is based solely on your
consent, which you may give or withdraw from Google per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. For data
collection operations not merged into your Google Account (for example, because you do not
have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is based on
Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing anonymous
user behavior for promotional purposes.</p><br>
